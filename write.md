# Best Practices of Massive Insert/Update/Delete

## Massive Insert
```python
import mysql.connector
import threading

# Establish a connection to the TiDB server
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='your_username', password='your_password',
                              host='your_hostname', database='your_database')

# Define the number of threads to use
num_threads = 4

# Define the number of records per batch
batch_size = 100

# Define the number of total records to insert
total_records = 10000

# Define a prepared statement for inserting data into a table
insert_stmt = "INSERT INTO some_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)"
insert_data = [('value1', 'value2') for i in range(batch_size)]

# Define a function for each thread to insert data in batches
def insert_data_thread(thread_num):
    cursor = cnx.cursor(prepared=True)
    start_index = thread_num * (total_records // num_threads)

    for i in range(start_index, start_index + total_records // num_threads, batch_size):
        data_to_insert = insert_data
        cursor.executemany(insert_stmt, data_to_insert)
        cnx.commit()

    cursor.close()

# Create the threads and start them
threads = []
for i in range(num_threads):
    t = threading.Thread(target=insert_data_thread, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to finish
for t in threads:
    t.join()

# Close the connection to the TiDB server
cnx.close()

```

In this code, we establish a connection to the TiDB server and define the number of threads, the number of records per batch, and the total number of records to insert. We define a prepared statement for inserting data into a table, with values that will be inserted later on. Then we define a function insert_data_thread() that each thread will execute, which inserts data in batches using a loop, and commits the transaction after each batch.

We create num_threads threads and start them, with each thread executing the insert_data_thread() function with its thread number as an argument. We wait for all threads to finish using the join() method, and then close the connection to the TiDB server.

By inserting data in small batches and using multi-threading and prepared statements, we can improve the performance of inserting data into TiDB.

## Massive Delete

### Delete all the data in a table
`TRUNCATE` statement is the best way to do this. It is much efficient than `DELETE` statement.

### Delete a range in a table

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection to the TiDB server
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='your_username', password='your_password',
                              host='your_hostname', database='your_database')

# Define the time range to delete data from
start_time = '2022-01-01 00:00:00'
end_time = '2022-01-31 23:59:59'

# Define the size of each transaction and the limit of rows to delete in each transaction
transaction_size = 1000
limit = 500

# Define a prepared statement for deleting data from a table
delete_stmt = "DELETE FROM some_table WHERE create_time >= %s AND create_time <= %s LIMIT %s"

# Initialize the number of affected rows to a non-zero value
num_affected_rows = 1

# Delete data in batches using a loop and a limit in the delete statement
cursor = cnx.cursor()
while num_affected_rows > 0:
    # Execute the prepared statement with the start and end time, and the limit
    cursor.execute(delete_stmt, (start_time, end_time, limit))
    # Get the number of affected rows and commit the transaction
    num_affected_rows = cursor.rowcount
    cnx.commit()
    print(f"Deleted {num_affected_rows} rows.")

# Make sure all the data has been deleted
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM some_table WHERE create_time >= %s AND create_time <= %s", (start_time, end_time))
remaining_rows = cursor.fetchone()[0]
if remaining_rows == 0:
    print("All rows have been deleted successfully.")
else:
    print(f"{remaining_rows} rows still remain.")

# Close the connection to the TiDB server
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```
In this code, we first establish a connection to the TiDB server and define the time range to delete data from, as well as the size of each transaction and the limit of rows to delete in each transaction.

We then define a prepared statement for deleting data from a table, with a where condition that specifies the time range and a limit to reduce the size of each transaction. We initialize the number of affected rows to a non-zero value to enter the loop, and delete data in batches using the loop and the prepared statement with the start and end time, and the limit. We get the number of affected rows and commit the transaction after each batch. We then make sure all the data has been deleted by checking the number of remaining rows, and print a message indicating whether all rows have been deleted successfully or not.

By deleting data within a specific time range and adding a limit to the delete statement, we can further optimize the performance of deleting data from TiDB.
